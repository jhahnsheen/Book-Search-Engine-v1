# BKSB Book Search Engine v1

The BKSB Book Search Engine is a web application that allows avid readers to search for books, save them to their profile, and revise their collection at well. This collection can be an online collection of favorite books or a wishlist of books. 

## Features

Every collection is saved to their user's account and can be accessed by the user every time they log in. New users will be able to create an account and start their book collections as well.

Users will be able to use a search bar to find books based on their queries. They can then pick from the search results and add it to their collection. At any time, they can view and edit their own collection.
